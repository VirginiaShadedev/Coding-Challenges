// Description:

//Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.




// First attempt 

// p(parameters): Create a function that reverses what it takes in. 
// r(return):returns the word in reverse. 
// e(example):
  // 'world'  =>  'dlrow'
  // 'word'   =>  'drow'
// p():  I will create a function that reverses what is inside a string.


function solution(str){
  return reverse(str)
}

// This was a failure. I wasn't sure if reverse was an actual way or valid in JS, but I still tried it.
